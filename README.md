- Bilingual corpora: training, tuning, and test sets for language pairs: Japanese-Vietnamese, Indonesian-Vietnamese, Malay-Vietnamese, Filipino-Vietnamese.
- 

2. Sentence alignment

- The Java implementation of [Moore, 2002] for sentence alignment.
- Extending word alignment by word similarity using word2vec

3. Pivot translation
- The Java implementation of [Wu and Wang, 2007].
