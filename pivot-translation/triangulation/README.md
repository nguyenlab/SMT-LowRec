The scripts are to train pivot translation, which induces a source-target phrase table given a source-pivot phrase table and a pivot-target phrase tables.

# data:
- phrase-table.src-pvt, phrase-table.pvt-trg: input phrase tables
- test.src, test.trg: the test set to filter input phrase tables

# Training
The script to train a triangulation model

        ./triangulation.sh
    
# Training with filtered phrase tables by a test set 
Input phrase tables are filtered by a test set, in which the filtered phrase tables contain only phrases included in the test set to speed up the training time.

        ./triangulation-filter.sh
